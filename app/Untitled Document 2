Hi,

I need to plot a 3D bar graph for my college project ,the bar garph is getting plotted but I want text to be displayed on each bar graph showing the values of its z-axis.

This is code snippet that shows for 2D graph:
[source code link][1]


	#!/usr/bin/env python
	# a bar plot with errorbars
	import numpy as np
	import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

	N = 5
	menMeans = (20, 35, 30, 35, 27)
	menStd =   (2, 3, 4, 1, 2)

	ind = np.arange(N)  # the x locations for the groups
	width = 0.35       # the width of the bars

	fig, ax = plt.subplots()
	rects1 = ax.bar(ind, menMeans, width, color='r', yerr=menStd)

	womenMeans = (25, 32, 34, 20, 25)
	womenStd =   (3, 5, 2, 3, 3)
	rects2 = ax.bar(ind+width, womenMeans, width, color='y', yerr=womenStd)

	# add some text for labels, title and axes ticks
	ax.set_ylabel('Scores')
	ax.set_title('Scores by group and gender')
	ax.set_xticks(ind+width)
	ax.set_xticklabels( ('G1', 'G2', 'G3', 'G4', 'G5') )

	ax.legend( (rects1[0], rects2[0]), ('Men', 'Women') )

	def autolabel(rects):
		# attach some text labels
		for rect in rects:
		    height = rect.get_height()
		    ax.text(rect.get_x()+rect.get_width()/2., 1.05*height, '%d'%int(height),
		            ha='center', va='bottom')

	autolabel(rects1)
	autolabel(rects2)

	plt.show()


code for 3D bar graph is [source code for 3d bar-graph][2]


In the 2D version the autolabel function use get_height(), get_x() and get_width() to calculate the height dynamically which in not supported in 3D version it gives:

*    patch3d error for function not found 

Is there any workaround to display text as in 2D graph.
